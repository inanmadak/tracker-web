## My Thoughts

- I think I have spent around 30-40 hours on this project, mostly on the frontend part. The reason being, I had not much 
of experience with React I had learned most things along the way (though I have working experience with AngularJS and Angular 5).
Hence I had started building the app and learned most of the things on the go. Previously I did know some basic React, Redux and middleware concepts. For this project I have chosen redux for global store and redux-saga as the main middleware to handle async flows, but also used a bit of React native state for small things. I think the figuring out redux-saga was the big step that took most of my time before I seriously built some stuff, then I just continued and mostly finished today.

- The app mostly delivers all expected features except ability to pause time. I mistakenly missed this part, then when I realized 
that, it was a bit late so I concetrated fine-tuning some other parts rather than adding this. Application works fully syncronized
so any permanent action user takes immediately persisted to database. Also there is ability to start or book multiple trackers.

- My overall thoughts are that I liked the project mostly, and this could be a tool I might use in the future. I used a similar
tool before - toggl.com - to keep track of time. One thing I would suggest is to make it a bit clear "Ability of booking time 
with and without tracker.". I found it confusing what the real difference is with this.
